# scrollie.js - HTML 5/JS Sinus Scroller

This demo was written as an exercise in JavaScript to learn the language and experiment with the perfomance of Canvas.
It should run pretty quickly on recent browsers and smartphones.

CodePen demo [available here](http://codepen.io/dwhinham/full/jEVbqN/)!

Beware: some pretty rotten image loading code in here.
